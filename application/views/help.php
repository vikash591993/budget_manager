                    The Transactions page
                </h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The Transactions page helps you deal with addition of all kinds of transactions.
                    <br/>
                    This page is further divided into 4 tabs
                    <br>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Add transactions</h4>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        This section is to add any kind of transaction except withdrawal
                        <br/>
                        Enter the date of the transaction 
                        <br/>
                        Then enter the amount you are going to deal with
                        <br/>
                        Enter any transaction notes you want to associate the transaction with . Remember that transaction notes can be very helpful to identify transactions later on . However please limit your transaction notes not to exceed the 150 character limit.
                        <br/>
                        Enter the no. of categories you want to enter the same transaction into . You will get as many no. of category boxes to enter the categories .
                        <br />
                        Enter the categories in the category boxes , here is the beauty of BM , you can enter the same transaction under multiple categories . hence making it easier to search n classify searches later . Ex. you can have a transaction to have travel and friend categories . so the expense will be classified under both travel expenses and friends expenses. 
                        <br/>
                        Then enter if peer is involved or not . A peer is anyone with whom you want to maintain an account on BM . i.e.  You expect to get or give money to them . So BM keeps track of your accounts with them.
                        <br/>
                        After that enter the name of peer . Please be careful while entering the name , we are trying to make this process error free  .
                        <br />
                        Then specify if you want the transaction to take place from/to hand or bank 
                        <br/>
                        After that you just specify if the transaction is resulting in you gaining money or is your budget being decremented .
                        
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Add Withdrawal </h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This is a small section to add withdrawals/deposits

                        <h4>Add credit/Debit </h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This is another small section wherein you can add a transaction to peer explicitly , you can however also add a transaction from the add transactions section 
                        <br/>
                        Enter the initial entering date 
                        <br />
                        Enter the amount

                        <br/>
                        debit -> you have given that amount to the peer 
                        <br/>
                        Then mention if transaction involved hand or involved bank

                        <h4>Delete category/peer </h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This is the section from where you can delete a peer / category and all transactions involving them . However doing so wouldn't reflect on your cash in hand or cash in bank . If you want to delete traces of those transactions such that your overall cash in hand or bank gets affected , please delete via search .
